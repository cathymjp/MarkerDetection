# A Study on Marker-Based Object Detection Method of Object Position Using Perspective Projection 

### Marker Detection Using Smartphone Camera (Research Project)
- Journal of Information and Communication Convergence Engineering (JICCE) 2022; 20(1); 65-72

## Environment
* 2020.1 ~ 2020.12 (12 months)
* Python3
* OpenCV
* Smart factory

## Model
![Modified_Origin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45842934/214560630-a006e263-9ecd-40d3-b606-766a71779244.png)

:small_orange_diamond: When the user moves the camera, the user's new viewpoint is calculated from the previous viewpoint using the coordinates of the four markers. The relationship between the center point of the image and the four markers is used to calculate the change in angle, distance, and size.

## Results
The algorithm was tested in two environments.
1. At the laboratory to test the execution of the algorithm - 1m and 1.5m
2. At the smart factory to test the real environment application
