- Journal of Information and Communication Convergence Engineering (JICCE) 2022; 20(1); 65-72

## Environment
* 2019.5 ~ 2021.2.14
* Python3
* OpenCV

### visual results
* Case example visual results as an aid for understanding the process
* For angle, distance, and size adjustment correction values

### test_pic
Pictures were taken at labatory to test the execution of the algorithm. Pictures were taken at the smart factory for application
* 1m and 1.5m for case examples
* SF for application at the smart factory
